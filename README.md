The ticket project is a Java application that provides a ticket purchasing and seat reservation system for a cinema. It allows users to select the number and type of tickets they want to purchase, including adult, child, and infant tickets. 
The system calculates the total amount to be paid based on the ticket prices and ensures that the business rules are followed, such as not allowing the purchase of child or infant tickets without an adult ticket. 
Once the tickets are purchased, the system also handles the payment processing and seat reservation using external services. The project aims to provide a convenient and reliable solution for managing ticket sales and seat allocation in a cinema environment.
